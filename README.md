git-tools
=========

git-tools - A package of tools for working with git repositories

### Requirements
* Needs to have `git`, `autopep8`, and `pep8`.

### Installation
* Working on this. Currently, the setup.py does not place the binaries in a usable place. Just run the executables in place.

## Documentation
* `git-pep8`
Iterates over all the python files in a repository and applies pep8 fixes. Each file/error code pair is committed separately. Author for the commit is taken from git config or the `--author` command line option.
