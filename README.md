git-tools
=========

git-tools - A package of tools for working with git repositories

### Requirements
* Needs to have `git`, `autopep8`, and `pep8`.

### Installation
* Install to `/usr/local/bin`
Use `sudo python setup.py install`
* Install to `~/.local/bin`
Use `python setup.py install --user`

## Documentation
* `git-pep8`
Iterates over all the python files in a repository and applies pep8 fixes.
The frequency of commit ranges from every file/error pair to once per run.
Automatic commit comment describes contents of change.
Author for the commit is taken from git config or the `--author` command line option.

## Typical usage
### `git-pep8`
* git-pep8 -r
Apply `autopep8` down a source tree, starting from the current directory
* git-pep8 --author=pep8
Attribute all changes applied to the user pep8
* git-pep8 --recurse ~/workspace/git-tools/src
Apply `autopep8` down a source tree, starting from STARTDIR

## Four modes of operation
1. all: checks for all errors over all files and commits to git once
2. by-file-only: iterate over files applying all errors at once, one commit per file
3. by reason-only: iterate over error types applying to all files at once, one commit per error type
4. by-file-and-reason: iterate over each error-file pair, committing once per error-file pair
The default is `by-file-and-reason`. Many developers find this produces too many commits to examine. It does have the advantage that
it is easy to examine a commit and see the scope of the change and the reason given for the change.
